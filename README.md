### How Everything Works Together

The system operates through a sophisticated pipeline architecture where each stage builds upon the previous:

#### 1. **Complete Analysis Pipeline Flow** (`main.py`)

```python
class CompleteSoccerAnalysisPipeline:
    """8-Stage End-to-End Analysis"""
    
    # Stage 1: Model Initialization
    def initialize_models():
        # Load YOLO detection model
        # Load YOLO keypoint model  
        # Initialize ByteTracker
        # Initialize SigLIP embedding extractor
        # Initialize UMAP + K-means models
    
    # Stage 2: Team Assignment Training
    def train_team_assignment():
        # Extract video frames (stride=12, first 120*24 frames)
        # Detect players in frames
        # Extract player crops from detections
        # Generate SigLIP embeddings (batch_size=24)
        # Train UMAP dimensionality reduction  
        # Train K-means clustering (k=2 teams)
    
    # Stage 3-7: Frame-by-Frame Processing  
    for each_frame:
        # Stage 3: Object Detection (players, ball, referees)
        # Stage 4: Keypoint Detection (29 field points)
        # Stage 5: Multi-object Tracking (ByteTrack)
        # Stage 6: Team Assignment (crop → embedding → cluster)
        # Stage 7: Tactical Analysis (homography transformation)
    
    # Stage 8: Post-Processing & Output
    def finalize_output():
        # Ball track interpolation (30-frame limit)
        # Frame annotation with team colors
        # Tactical overlay generation
        # Video output writing
```

#### 2. **Detection Pipeline Details**

```python
# Object Detection Process
YOLO Model → Frame Input → [
    Class 0: Players (with bounding boxes)
    Class 1: Ball (with confidence scores)  
    Class 2: Referees (with positions)
] → Supervision Detections Format
```

#### 3. **Tracking Pipeline Process**

```python  
# Multi-Object Tracking Chain
Player Detections → ByteTrack → [
    Consistent Track IDs
    Motion Prediction
    Re-identification
] → Tracked Detections → Team Assignment → [
    Player Crops Extraction
    SigLIP Embedding (512-dim)
    UMAP Reduction (3-dim)  
    K-means Clustering (2 teams)
] → Team-Labeled Players
```

#### 4. **Keypoint Detection & Tactical Analysis**

```python
# Field Analysis Process  
Frame → YOLO Pose Model → 29 Keypoints → [
    Corner flags (4 points)
    Penalty areas (8 points)
    Goal areas (4 points)
    Center circle (3 points)
    Side touchlines (6 points)
    Goal lines (4 points)
] → Homography Matrix → Pitch Coordinates → Tactical View
```

The `main.py` serves as the primary entry point featuring the `CompleteSoccerAnalysisPipeline` class:

### Pipeline Architecture
```python

```

### 8-Stage Analysis Process

1. **Model Initialization**: Load all YOLO models and initialize tracking components

   - Update tracking with ByteTrack
   - Assign team colors through clustering
   - Generate tactical coordinates
5. **Ball Interpolation**: Fill missing ball detections using linear interpolation
6. **Annotation**: Draw bounding boxes, IDs, team colors on frames
7. **Tactical Overlay**: Combine original video with tactical field view
8. **Output Generation**: Write final analyzed video

### Performance Metrics
- **Real-time Processing**: ~30 FPS on modern GPUs
